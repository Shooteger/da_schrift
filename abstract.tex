\chapter{Abstract}
Through an iOS and Android app, the core premise is to help promoter-managers and management with organisational effort. 
With the system an admin can create a user, these accounts belong to the group of the so-called \textbf{promoters}.
The task of the promoter is selling tickets and raising awareness to the specific event, which he/she is assigned to. 
When a promoter sells a card, he/she must update his/her current stock of cards, that is stored in the app and thus points get credited to the account.
With this procedure the management keeps a relatively up-to-date status of how many tickets are sold and the points of all promoters.
They get certain goodies such as free tickets or drink vouchers when they reach a certain number of points.
Additionally, if there are any questions a promoter can contact an admin in a private chat.
Overall, the software will automate steps and make them easier for offering more security,
especially in the field of data protection and provides statistics and a collection of data for future events, which have not been possible to such an extent.
